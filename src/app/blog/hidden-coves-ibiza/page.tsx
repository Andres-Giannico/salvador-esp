            When most people think of Ibiza, they picture iconic beach clubs, lively sunsets, and turquoise bays. 
            But beyond the well-known shores lies a different Ibiza — one that's wild, intimate, and completely untouched.
            Aboard a private charter with <strong>Salvador Ibiza</strong>, you'll unlock a secret coastline of hidden 
            coves and secluded beaches only accessible by boat.

          <h2>What Makes Ibiza's Hidden Coves So Special?</h2>
          <p>
            These places are not on tourist maps.
            They're known only to locals and experienced sailors — peaceful enclaves where pine forests touch the sea, 
            cliffs offer natural shelter, and the only soundtrack is the gentle movement of the waves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Imagine anchoring in a calm, crystal-clear bay where the water is so transparent you can see the seabed 
            from the deck. No noise, no crowds — just you, your group, and the raw beauty of the island.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Favorite Hidden Gems</h2>
          <p>Every outing with us is different, but here are just a few of the natural wonders that await:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Sandy inlets nestled between cliffs, ideal for swimming in total privacy</li>
            <li>Remote snorkeling spots with vibrant marine life and shallow underwater caves</li>
            <li>Impressive rock formations, perfect for exploration or simply taking it all in</li>
            <li>Natural sea caves accessible by paddleboard or kayak</li>
            <li>Quiet anchorages, perfect for sunbathing or disconnecting from the outside world</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Our experienced crew knows the coastline intimately and will choose the best places based on sea conditions, 
            wind direction, and your personal preferences.
